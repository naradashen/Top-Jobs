Female sex workers (FSWs) in Sri Lanka face widespread stigma and discrimination, which increases their vulnerability to violence and reduces their access to healthcare and legal protection.

The study will employ a mixed-method cross-sectional design, including a quantitative survey using Respondent Driven Sampling approach, in-depth case studies of individual FSW experiences, and focus group discussions. This approach will provide both statistical and contextual insights into the challenges faced by FSWs.  Project objectives are threefold:  ¢ To measure the prevalence and forms of stigma, discrimination, and violence experienced by female sex workers in Colombo City.  « To assess the factors associated with violence and their consequences on FSWs’ physical health, mental well-being, and access to health and social services (e.g. HIV prevention, reproductive health, legal aid).  ¢ To develop evidence-based recommendations for policies, programs, or advocacy initiatives that address stigma and violence against FSWs and improve their safety, health, and human rights.

        "Extracted Text": "Terms of Reference — Data Analyst / RDS Specialist Introduction and Background  The Community Strengthen Development Foundation (CSDF), with support from FPA Sri Lanka and funding from IPPF’s Stream-2 Sex Work Consortium Grant, is conducting a research project titled “Stigma, Discrimination, and Violence among Female Sex Workers in Colombo City, Sri Lanka.” This study is investigating the experiences of female sex workers (FSWs) with social stigma, discrimination, and gender-based violence, and how these factors impact their health and access to services. To achieve a comprehensive understanding, the project employs a mixed-method design. A major component is a quantitative survey among FSWs in Colombo, carried out using Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS) to reach this hidden population. In addition, qualitative methods (including in-depth interviews/case studies and focus group discussions) are being used to gather contextual insights. With this volume of data and the complex RDS methodology, specialized analytical expertise is required to ensure the data are correctly processed, analyzed, and translated into meaningful findings.  The Consultancy  CSDF is seeking a skilled Data Analyst (RDS Specialist) to support the project in managing and analyzing the data collected, particularly the quantitative survey data obtained via respondent-driven sampling. This is a short-term consultancy for 10 working days in total, expected to take place during the analysis phase of the project. The Data/RDS Analyst will work closely with the Research Coordinator and the Public Health/GBV Consultant to produce high-quality analysis and results. He/She will be responsible for cleaning the databases, performing advanced statistical analyses (including applying RDS weighting techniques), and contributing to the interpretation and reporting of the findings. The consultant should be available on a focused, full-time-equivalent basis for those 10 days.  Key Responsibilities:  + Designing the RDS Strategy: Designing the RDS Strategy, data collection tools, seed selection, site selection and the RDS process.  « Data Management and Cleaning: Take charge of the quantitative survey dataset as it comes in from the field. Merge, organize, and clean the data from all respondents. This includes checking for errors or inconsistencies, handling duplicate entries (if any), coding open-ended responses, and ensuring that all variables are labeled and documented properly. Verify that referral coupon codes and network sizes (degree counts) for RDS are accurately recorded, as these are crucial for analysis.  « Database Setup: Set up the analysis database in the appropriate statistical software (including RDS Analyst). Implement the structures needed for RDS analysis, including variables for seeds, recruitment chains, and weighting adjustments. Ensure that the data file is secure and that identifying information (if any) is separated to maintain confidentiality.  + RDS Weighting and Estimation: Apply respondent-driven sampling analysis techniques to the survey data. This involves calculating individual weights based on network size and recruitment patterns, assessing convergence and homophily as needed, and generating population estimates for key outcome variables (¢.g., proportion of FSWs experiencing a particular form of violence or stigma). Use specialized RDS analysis software or scripts to derive these estimates with confidence intervals.  + Statistical Analysis: Conduct comprehensive quantitative analyses addressing the study objectives. This includes descriptive statistics (frequencies, means) for all relevant indicators, as well as bivariate or multivariate analyses to explore associations (for example, examining correlations between experienced violence and health-seeking behavior, or differences in outcomes by age group or location). Ensure that any hypothesis tests or regression models account for the sampling design (RDS) as appropriate. If needed, perform subgroup analyses for various segments of the FSW population (such as by type of sex work, or those with vs. without prior exposure to interventions) to provide deeper insight.  * Qualitative Data Integration: While the primary responsibility is quantitative, collaborate with the team to integrate quantitative and qualitative findings. Advise the Research Coordinator or qualitative researchers on any trends that emerge from the numbers that could be illuminated by qualitative narratives, and vice versa. (E.g., if data shows a high percentage reporting police harassment, suggest highlighting a case study from the qualitative data that exemplifies this.)  ¢ Data Visualization: Produce clear tables, graphs, and charts that illustrate the key findings. This includes generating any figures needed for the final report or presentations — for instance, bar charts of discrimination types, line diagrams of RDS recruitment chains (if useful to illustrate sample composition), or info-graphics combining multiple data points. Ensure all visuals are properly labeled and easy to interpret by non-technical audiences.  ¢ Documentation of Analysis: Maintain a well-documented record of all analysis procedures. If programming scripts (in R, SAS or Stata, etc.) are used, ensure they are commented and saved. Prepare a codebook for the dataset, listing all variables, definitions, and any derived variables created. This documentation will allow the project team (and possibly external reviewers) to understand and, if needed, replicate the analysis.  ¢ Interim Findings and Collaboration: Communicate preliminary results to the project team in a timely manner. Work closely with the Research Coordinator and the GBV Consultant to discuss what the data are indicating, so that the interpretation remains grounded in context. Be open to feedback or additional analysis requests — for example, if the team or stakeholders ask for a specific cross-tabulation or if an unexpected pattern needs further probing, accommodate such iterative analysis within the available time.  « Report Writing Support: Contribute to the drafting of the results section of the final research report. Provide a concise written summary of the methodology (data handling and analysis approach) and the key statistical findings. Ensure that the narrative accurately reflects the data and that any statistics quoted in text match the computed results. Work with the team to ensure that complex statistical findings are explained in clear, non-technical language in the report.  « Presentation of Results: If requested, assist in presenting the data findings during the project’s dissemination events or stakeholder meetings. Prepare a slide deck or data summary handouts focusing on the quantitative results, and be ready to explain the analysis process (including what RDS is and why it was used) to an audience that may include community members and policymakers. Address any technical questions about the data that arise during these discussions.  Person Specifications: « Educational Qualifications: Bachelor’s degree or master degree in Statistics, Biostatistics, Applied Statistics, Data Science or a related discipline.  + Analytical Experience: At least 3-5 years of proven experience in data analysis for research or monitoring & evaluation in the health or social sector. Experience working with survey data is required. Specific experience with Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS) data is highly desirable — for example, having analyzed data from key population surveys (such as among sex workers, people who use drugs, etc.) using RDS adjustments.  « Software Proficiency: Strong skills in statistical software. Proficiency in R (with packages for survey/RDS analysis), STATA or SAS is ideal; knowledge of specialized RDS analysis tools (like RDS Analyst or RDSAT) is required. Familiarity with data management in Excel and ability to produce data visualizations (in tools like R, Excel or Prower-BI) is an added advantage.  * Quantitative Skills: Solid understanding of statistical concepts, including sampling methods, weighting, variance estimation, and regression analysis. Able to independently carry out data cleaning, manage large datasets, and implement analyses ranging from descriptive to multivariate techniques. High level of comfort with interpreting and explaining statistical outputs.  « Attention to Detail: Demonstrated meticulousness in handling data — ensuring accuracy, catching errors, and validating results. A strong commitment to data quality and integrity is essential, given the sensitive nature of this study’s data.  «¢ Communication: Good written and oral communication skills in English. Able to translate statistical findings into clear insights and explain technical approaches to non- specialists. Experience contributing to research reports or academic papers is an asset.  + Collaboration: Ability to work as part of a team and under the guidance of project leads. Responsive to feedback and flexible in making adjustments to analysis as needed. Professional demeanor when discussing data and findings, including openness to cross- disciplinary input (from field staff, subject matter experts, etc.).  ¢ Confidentiality and Ethics: Understanding of and commitment to research ethics, especially with sensitive data. Must ensure confidentiality of all datasets (sign a confidentiality agreement if required) and handle any identifying information with utmost care. Familiarity with ethical guidelines for research on vulnerable groups is appreciated.  ¢ Availability: Willingness to commit to intense work periods on short notice when data collection is completed. Able to deliver outputs within tight timelines. Ideally available to participate in meetings or presentations (virtually or in Colombo) when results are being finalized and shared.  Deliverables: 1. Sample Size Calculation and Sampling Procedure is completed: Design the sampling strategy, sample size calculation and document the sampling procedure including seed selection, special data collection requirements, etc.  2. Cleaned & Labeled Dataset: A complete, cleaned quantitative dataset of all survey responses from FSW participants, with all variables clearly labeled and any necessary coding/recoding performed. This should be accompanied by a data codebook describing each variable and the value labels, including documentation of any computed RDS weights or derived indicators.  3. Statistical Analysis Outputs: A set of statistical results addressing each research question. This will include:  o Descriptive statistics (tables of frequencies/percentages for categorical variables, and means/medians for continuous variables) for key characteristics and outcomes.  o Analytical tables or figures (e.g., cross-tabulations or model summaries) that examine relationships of interest (such as the association between experienced stigma and health service uptake, etc.), adjusted for RDS design where applicable.  © Graphical visualizations (at least 3-5 key charts or graphs) that can be used in the report or presentations to illustrate important _ findings. These outputs should be delivered in an organized manner, e.g. as an Excel file with tables, image files of graphs, or an SPSS/Stata output file, along with a brief explanation of each.  4. Preliminary Findings Brief: A short memo or presentation (2-5 pages or slides) summarizing the initial key findings from the data, prepared after the first round of analysis. This will be used by the team for internal discussion and validation of results before finalizing the report.  y  Contribution to Final Report: Written input for the “Results” and “Methods” sections of the final research report. Specifically, a summary of the data analysis methods (including the RDS approach) and a narrative of the quantitative results, with interpretation. The analyst will provide this in a format ready to be incorporated into the draft report (or as feedback on drafts prepared by the report writers).  Effort Estimation: 10 working days (full-time equivalent).  Time Frame: The analysis consultancy is expected to take place around July 2025 to January 2026. All analysis and deliverables should be completed by end of January 2026.  Remuneration: Negitiable.

        "Extracted Text": "GIPPF=  Fsaivanna ning elaianaips  Terms of Reference  Consultant (Public Health /GBV Expert)  Introduction and Background  The Community Strengthen Development Foundation (CSDF), in partnership with FPA Sri Lanka, is implementing the research project “Stigma, Discrimination, and Violence among Female Sex Workers in Colombo City, Sri Lanka,” supported by the IPPF Stream-2 Sex Worker Consortium Grant. Female sex workers (FSWs) in Colombo face multifaceted challenges: pervasive social stigma, discriminatory treatment by institutions and community, and a high risk of gender-based violence (from intimate partners, clients, law enforcement, etc.). These factors not only violate their fundamental rights but also pose serious public health concerns — for instance, stigma and violence can drive FSWs away from essential health services, increasing vulnerability to HIV/STIs, reproductive health and mental health issues. Through this project, CSDF aims to gather robust evidence on the prevalence and consequences of stigma, discrimination, and violence against FSWs, and to use these insights to advocate for improved policies and support services. The study utilizes a mixed-method approach (including an RDS-based survey of FSWs, qualitative case studies with FSWs, and focus group discussions) to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the issues.  The Consultancy  CSDF is seeking a qualified Public Health / Gender-Based Violence (GBV) Expert as a short-term Consultant to provide technical guidance for the successful execution of the above- mentioned research. The consultant will bring subject matter expertise in public health research and GBV to ensure that the study design, data collection, and analysis appropriately address the sensitive and complex issues at hand. This consultancy will span 25 working days in total, spread over the project period (approximately mid-2025 through early 2026), with specific timing of inputs to be agreed based on project needs. The consultant will work closely with the CSDF research team (including the Research Coordinator and Data Analyst) and FPA Sri Lanka technical experts. He/She will function as the technical lead on GBV and health aspects. — ensuring ethical and sound methodologies, building team capacity on these topics, and contributing to the interpretation and dissemination of findings.  Key Responsibilities:  « Technical Input to Study Design: Provide expert guidance in refining the research methodology to appropriately capture issues of stigma, discrimination, and violence. Review and contribute to the development of the research protocol, survey questionnaire, interview guides, and other data collection tools to ensure they are culturally sensitive and align with international best practices for researching vulnerable populations. This includes formulating questions on GBV and human rights in a non-judgmental, safe manner and ensuring indicators align with global standards.  + Ethics and Safeguarding: Work with the team to integrate strong ethical safeguards into the study. Advise on protocols for obtaining informed consent from FSW participants, especially for discussions of violence and other traumatic experiences. Develop strategies for participant safety — for example, creating a plan to maintain privacy during interviews and a distress protocol if participants become upset or disclose immediate harm. Ensure the final study protocol submitted for ethical approval adequately addresses all GBV-related ethical considerations and timely acquisition of ethical clearance from a recognized Ethical Review Committee in Sri Lanka.  «Referral Mechanisms: Establish and document a referral mechanism for participants who may require support services. Leverage knowledge of local GBV response resources (such as shelters, counseling services, legal aid, health clinics) to create a referral list. Train the research team on how to offer information about or referral to these services to any participant disclosing experiences of violence or other urgent needs, following a “do no harm” approach.  «Training and Capacity Building: Lead the development of training content on GBV and ethical research practices for the project’s data collection team. Conduct training sessions (and refreshers as needed) for enumerators and qualitative interviewers, focusing on topics such as: how to ask sensitive questions about violence, handling disclosures of abuse, confidentiality and anonymity, and interviewer self-care. Ensure that by the end of training, all team members are confident and capable of collecting data in a trauma-informed and non-stigmatizing manner.  « Data Collection Oversight: Oversight all data collection activities. This includes managing the respondent-driven sampling (RDS) process for the quantitative survey — overseeing seed selection, coupon distribution and tracking, and monitoring recruitment waves — as well as scheduling and organizing qualitative interviews and focus group discussions. Ensure data collection is carried out safely, efficiently, and per the study protocol.  « Ongoing Technical Advisory: Serve as an on-call expert during the data collection phase. Provide advice and troubleshooting for any technical questions that arise in the field related to the content of questionnaires or handling of participant situations (e.g., if an interviewer encounters a challenging scenario or if preliminary data show an unexpected trend that needs contextual understanding). Conduct periodic check-ins to ensure field implementation remains aligned with ethical and quality standards.  « Data Analysis and Interpretation: Collaborate with the Data/RDS Analyst and Research Coordinator during the analysis phase to ensure that the interpretation of results, particularly those related to violence, stigma, and health outcomes, is accurate and nuanced. Help identify key themes and patterns in the qualitative data (stories from case studies or focus groups) regarding GBV and discrimination. For quantitative results, guide the team in understanding correlations or risk factors related to violence and stigma. Ensure that gender and rights perspectives are applied when analyzing and discussing the findings.  + Recommendations and Strategy Development: Based on the research findings, lead the formulation of practical recommendations for various stakeholders. This may include recommendations for health service providers on making services more accessible and stigma-free, suggestions for law enforcement or policymakers on protecting the rights of FSWs, and identifying areas for community-based interventions to reduce violence. The consultant will ensure that these recommendations are evidence-based and aligned with both local context and international best practices in GBV prevention/response.  + Report Writing and Review: Contribute significantly to the writing of the final research report, especially the sections that pertain to GBV, stigma, and public health implications. Ensure that the report clearly articulates the findings on violence and discrimination and ties them to broader public health and human rights frameworks. Review draft reports or publications for technical accuracy and completeness. Additionally, assist in preparing policy briefs that may arise from the project.  ¢ Dissemination and Advocacy: Support the dissemination of results to stakeholders. This may involve co-facilitating workshops or presentations for government officials, community leaders, and partner organizations. Present the key findings and recommendations on GBV and stigma, and help answer technical questions from the audience. Where appropriate, advise on advocacy strategies for CSDF and partners to use the evidence generated to influence policy or programmatic change (e.g., contributions to developing advocacy materials or engaging with media, if required).  Person Specifications:  « Educational Background: An advanced degree in a relevant field — such as Public Health, Community Medicine, Gynecology, Gender Studies, Sociology, or Psychology. (For example, a Master of Public Health or a medical degree with specialization in public health or a PhD in a related social science.) Additional training or certification in gender-based violence or human rights will be an advantage.  + Professional Experience: A minimum of 8-10 years of experience in the public health or development sector, with substantial work focused on gender-based violence, women’s health, or key populations. Experience designing or leading research studies or large surveys in a social/public health context is required. Candidates who have served as Principal Investigator or lead researcher on studies around GBV, or stigma are preferred.  + Exposure to the National Health Systems: Exposure and experience in health sector response to Gender Based Violence, gender mainstreaming and the overall national health system.  «Technical Expertise: Deep understanding of GBV dynamics and prevention/response strategies, including familiarity with national policies and services related to GBV in Sri Lanka. Up-to-date knowledge of ethical research practices involving human subjects, particularly in sensitive topics. Proficient in both quantitative and qualitative research methods; able to advise on statistical relevance as well as qualitative rigor.  e Training & Facilitation Skills: Demonstrated ability to train and mentor others, especially on sensitive topics. Excellent communication skills with the ability to convey complex concepts to diverse audiences (research team, community members, and officials).  « Analytical & Writing Skills: Strong analytical skills to interpret research data within sociocultural context. Proven track record of contributing to high-quality research reports, academic publications, or policy briefs. Ability to synthesize data into actionable insights and recommendations is essential.  « Language and Communication: Fluency in English is required (for report writing and technical communication). Proficiency in Sinhala and/or Tamil is highly desirable, given the local context — the consultant should be able to review tools or training content in local language and communicate with field staff or participants as needed. Excellent writing skills with clarity and precision.  + Interpersonal Skills: Capacity to work collaboratively with a multidisciplinary team. Culturally sensitive and respectful approach, especially when dealing with topics around sex work and violence. The consultant should demonstrate empathy, discretion, and professionalism at all times when engaging with project staff and participants.  + Availability: Ability to commit to intermittent engagement over the project period and flexibility in scheduling (some inputs may be needed on short notice during critical phases such as tool finalization, training, or results interpretation). Willingness to travel within Colombo city as required for trainings or meetings.  Deliverables:  1. Inception Report and Work Plan: A detailed work plan at the start of the assignment, including a timeline of activities, training plans, and a finalized research protocol (ready for ethics submission).  2. Ethical Approval Obtained: Coordination and submission of the study protocol to an Ethical Review Committee, resulting in an ethics clearance letter/approval for the research.  3. Data Collection Completion: Completion of field data collection for the survey (target of ~550 FSW respondents reached via RDS), as well as all planned qualitative interviews (case studies) and focus group discussions.  4. Draft Final Report: A comprehensive draft research report compiling all findings (quantitative and qualitative) and recommendations, submitted to CSDF/FPA Sri Lanka for review by the end of the contract period.  5. Final Research Report and Dissemination: The finalized research report, revised after feedback, and a successful dissemination event (workshop) conducted to present key findings to stakeholders. Presentation slides and a summary brief for dissemination should also be produced as part of this deliverable.  Effort Estimation: 25 working days (spread intermittently across the project duration).  Time Frame: The engagement is expected roughly from June 2025 to January 2026, during which the 25 working days will be allocated at key milestones.  Remuneration: Negotiable.

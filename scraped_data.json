Overview HELVETAS Swiss Intercooperation is an independent development organization having its Country Office in Colombo, Sri Lanka and supporting many Projects and Partner Organizations in the Country committing to a just world in which all men and women determine the course of their lives in dignity and security, using environmental resources in a sustainable manner.  HELVETAS is entrusted with the implementation of the Project: Empowering Youth-led initiatives in Preventing Violent Extremism in Sri Lanka (EMPOWER). This project aims to enhance the resilience and capacity on Prevention of Violent Extremism (PVE) of youth from diverse ethnic, religious, cultural, and social backgrounds. A key area that the EMPOWER project focuses on is the engagement of most vulnerable youth to address their vulnerability / risk of radicalization towards violent extremism due to the lack of economic or livelihood opportunities. By addressing this issue through avenues, guidance for improved livelihoods and employment skills, these targeted youth would have sources of income and as a result be less vulnerable to violent extremism agendas and ideologies.  For this purpose, EMPOWER project implements subgrants projects in Kalutara, Kandy, and Ampara districts to provide improved livelihood and employability skills for youth at risk of recruitment in VE groups or radicalisation to engage in sustainable income generation activities and thereby avoid risk of radicalization.
